# Few-shot for object detection
1. Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection
2. Few-shot Object Detection via Feature Reweighting
3. Frustratingly Simple Few-Shot Object Detection


# Image retrieval
1. NetVLAD with attention: attention can be generated by segmentation, we can use this attention to erase 'something' that have negative effects on retrival (such as person).
2. Unsupervised Part-based Weighting Aggregation of Deep Convolutional Features for Image Retrieval
3. ATTENTION-AWARE AGE-AGNOSTIC VISUAL PLACE RECOGNITION
4. Deep Attentional Structured Representation Learning for Visual Recognition (Some regions provide more discriminative information)
